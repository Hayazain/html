        <p>Namal Novel is very famous social, romantic Urdu novel.The ending of this brilliant novel is as satisfying as it can get. Everyone got what they deserved. Villains got their punishment</p>
        <p>Overall, Namal was a fast-paced, edge of the seat marvellously executed mystery- thriller. Honestly Finale of the novel is very much predictable and rightly so. My regular readers will second me that I predicted almost same sort of denouement.</p>
        <h3>STORY</h3>
        <p>Namal means ants, which are considered to be one of the most unique creature of ALLAH PAK- The Almighty. The novel "Namal" revolves around the people who are considered as the weakest elements of the society, just like the ants who are apparently the weakest of the creatures.</p>
